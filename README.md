A paint/sketch project built while studying TOP.
What I learned:
* Passing parameter to event listener using anonymous function , bind method (wasn't used in the code) and storing inside DOM object.
* Making pseudo event listener by combining many type of event listeners.
* Making rainbow text, range slider and color input.
